# project-3
Redo project 2, using Objects (classes for Ball, Button, etc.)

Table has four sides, plus a "wall" down the middle (as in the midterm exam).

FIVE pool balls, each with a different color and a different number on it.
The "cue" ball is white, with no number; it starts at rest, in the middle of the LEFT half of the table.

Balls bounce off sides of table (left or wall, top, right, bottom), and collide "elastically" with one another.

In an "elastic" collision, the velocities are exchanged  
(i.e. the DX and DY of one ball become the DX and DY of the other ball!)  

Add **buttons** to do the following:

  - reset four of the balls to a position on the right side of the table, giving each a random velocity.
  Also reset the cue ball to the middle of the LEFT half of the table, with NO velocity,
  and restore the "wall".
   
  - remove the "wall" (and allow balls to move anywhere within the table).
