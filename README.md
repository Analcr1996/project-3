# project-3
Redo project 2, using Objects (classes for Ball, Button, etc.)

Table has four sides, plus a "wall" down the middle (as in the midterm exam).

FIVE pool balls, each with a different color and a different number on it.
The "cue" ball is white, with no number; it starts at rest, in the middle of the LEFT half of the table.

Balls bounce off sides of table (left or wall, top, right, bottom), and collide "elastically" with one another.
(In an "elastic" collision, velocities are exchanged, i.e. DX & DY of one ball become DX & DY of the other ball!)  

Add **buttons** to do the following:
  - RESET:  Reset four balls to a random velocities and positions on the right half.
  Also restore the "wall" and reset cue ball with NO velocity, centered within LEFT half of table.
  - WALL:  Remove the "wall" (and allow balls to move anywhere within the table).
